# Surrounding Elements In Matrix
This code shows how to get the neighboring items for a given one in a matrix.

## Example
Suppose we have the following matrix. Need to find the surroundings items for the **zero** item:

[4   7   1   3   1]  
[9   5   2   5  4]  
[6   3   4   **0**   1]  
[8   5   8   4  9]  

Surrounding items: `[2, 5, 4, 4, 1, 8, 4, 9]`
